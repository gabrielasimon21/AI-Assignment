To run, it's necessary to have python installed in your machine.
It is possible to choose between three game modes: Human VS Human, Human VS Bot and Bot VS Bot.
It is necessary to have the game mode file chosen in the same folder as globalVars.py and all the png images. 
To run the game, just paste the code for the chosen game mode in your favorite editor and hit run!

Have fun :)
